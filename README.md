# Machine Learning with DÃ¡maso Erling


Programming assignments that I implemented in python of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (it uses Octave/MATLAB). I also added some concepts and formulas that I think are useful to help to understand the algorithms.

In order to have a nice visualization of the concepts, formulas, codes and exercises, I did all the implementations in Jupyter Notebooks.
